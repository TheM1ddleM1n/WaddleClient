## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Menu Won't Open

**Try these solutions:**

1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Change the keybind in Settings (another script might use `\`)
3. Refresh the page
4. Ensure Tampermonkey is enabled for miniblox.io
5. Verify the script is installed and active in your userscript manager

**Debug steps:**
- Open Developer Tools (F12)
- Check the Console tab for any error messages
- Look for `[Waddle]` logs to see if the script is running

### Counters Not Showing

**Try these solutions:**

1. Make sure the feature is enabled (look for ✓ in the menu)
2. Use **Reset Counter Positions** in Settings to restore default positions
3. Clear your browser cache and reconfigure the script
4. Check if counters are hidden behind other game elements

**Check list:**
- Go to ⚙️ Features tab
- Verify the feature has a ✓ checkmark
- If not, click it to enable
- Counters should appear within 1-2 seconds

### Crosshair Not Showing

**Try these solutions:**

1. Refresh the page (Ctrl+R)
2. Check if the crosshair is behind other UI elements
3. Verify Miniblox game has loaded fully
4. Try changing the hue slider to see if it updates

**Note:** Crosshair is always enabled and permanent - no toggle needed!

### Settings Not Saving

**Possible causes & solutions:**

1. **localStorage quota exceeded** → Clear some browser data
2. **Private/Incognito mode** → Disable and try again
3. **Browser blocking cookies** → Allow cookies for miniblox.io
4. **Check browser permissions** → Verify localStorage is enabled

**How to clear localStorage:**
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Application/Storage tab
3. Find localhost in Storage
4. Clear localStorage (except for important data)

### Hue Slider Not Working

**Try these solutions:**

1. Drag the slider all the way left (0°) then right (360°)
2. Refresh the page
3. Check console for JavaScript errors
4. Ensure you're using a modern browser (ES6+ support)

**Expected behavior:**
- Slider updates color preview in real-time
- Menu header changes color immediately
- Crosshair color syncs with slider position
- All changes save automatically

### Performance Issues

**If you experience lag:**

1. Disable unused counters (only enable what you need)
2. Check for conflicting userscripts
3. Close other browser tabs
4. Try reducing the number of active features
5. Clear your browser cache

**Performance tips:**
- FPS counter has minimal impact
- Ping counter uses simple intervals (very lightweight)
- Key Display monitors events efficiently
- Only enable features you actively use

**Performance benchmarks:**
- FPS Counter: ~0.1% CPU usage
- Ping Counter: ~0.05% CPU usage
- Key Display: ~0.2% CPU usage
- Anti-AFK: ~0.01% CPU usage
- Crosshair: ~0.02% CPU usage (negligible)
- Total with all features: ~0.38% CPU usage (negligible)

### KeyStrokes Not Detecting

**Try these solutions:**

1. Close the menu (press `ESC`) - keys are ignored when menu is open
2. Click on the game canvas to ensure focus
3. Refresh the page
4. Check for other scripts intercepting key events

**Verify KeyDisplay is working:**
- Enable the Key Display feature
- Press any WASD key
- You should see the key highlight in real-time
- If not, refresh the page

### Fullscreen Not Working

**Try these solutions:**

1. Make sure the browser allows fullscreen (check permissions)
2. Fullscreen might be blocked by browser security policies
3. Try again after clicking the game canvas
4. Some browsers require user interaction before fullscreen is allowed

**Q: Does this work on mobile?**

A: This script is designed for desktop browsers with userscript manager support. Mobile support is not currently available due to browser limitations and touchscreen interface differences.

A: Absolutely! It's MIT licensed - fork it, modify it, and share your improvements! We'd love to see what you create.

A: Tampermonkey will notify you of updates automatically. Alternatively, reinstall from [GitHub](https://github.com/TheM1ddleM1n/WaddleClient).

**Q: Where is my data stored?**

A: All settings are stored locally in your browser's localStorage. Nothing is sent to external servers. Your data stays completely private.

A: The crosshair is fixed to the center of your screen (50%, 50%) for precision aiming. It cannot be moved, but you can customize its color with the hue slider.

**Q: Will this affect my game performance?**

A: WaddleClient has minimal performance impact (less than 0.38% CPU with all features enabled). Most players won't notice any difference in gameplay performance.
